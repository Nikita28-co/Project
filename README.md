# Project


Yoga Pose Classification and Feedback System using Computer Vision and Machine Learning

>  Developed an application that uses OpenCV, Mediapipe, and HandTracking for real-time yoga pose detection and classification.
>  Implemented pose analysis algorithms to identify various yoga poses (Warrior II, Tree Pose, T Pose) based on joint angles.
>  Integrated text-to-speech functionality using pyttsx3 to provide verbal feedback for correct posture.
>  Utilized HandTracking to enhance user interaction and feedback accuracy.
>  Achieved real-time pose classification with 95% accuracy on a webcam interface.
